This folder contains all of the files used to create the [Print Cassidy](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2679412035) character mod, including the source files for building the custom pink hair anim.

# Command to build the anim:

```bash
./kanimal-cli.exe kanim anim_source/printcassidy_accessories.scml --output ./anim_files/ --interpolate
```

Above command requires the [kanimal-SE](https://github.com/skairunner/kanimal-SE) executable to be placed in this folder.
